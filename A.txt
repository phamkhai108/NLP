Wiki pronunciation ˈwɪki from Hawaii Wikiwiki, which is also quickly called an open project as a type of construction application and management of information pages developed by many people.Do not be built focused on the principle of decentralization as usual in CMS or Forum applications, but according to the principle of dispersion, anyone can edit, add new, add information to news sites and do not recordAgain who has provided that information
The author of Wiki according to the philosophy of those who have built the Wiki software is the author of this information that we are
Such news sites are built and supplemented based on the dynamics of the community.
Wiki is a website with privacy for a group or organization or community
Unlike a traditional website for the purpose of reading, viewing information, Wiki allows users to edit, modify and update information directly to the web in the form of information contribution
The remarkable point of Wiki is that users do not necessarily know about the web, HTML.234
Wikipedia, a project to build an open encyclopedia, is probably the most famous Wiki in the world, but can also use the Wiki form for many other purposes.
The first software is called Wiki, 6 Wikiwikiweb by Ward Cunningham
Cunningham misses an employee at Honolulu International Airport, only he uses the Chance RT52 bus route called Wiki Wiki
According to Cunningham, I chose Wikiwiki as the phrase that replaced Quick to avoid the name of this one is Quickweb
Wiki Wiki is Wiki's words, Hawaii word has a quick meaning
From Wiki referred to for Wiki Wiki
Sometimes this word is explained as the background structure of the Backronym of what I know is what I know is, that explanation describes the functions of contributing, storing and exchanging knowledge.78
According to Cunningham, the opinion of Wiki originated from a stack he created in Hypercard in the late 1980s
About ten years later, Wiki technology slowly recognized as a promising way to manage secret and public knowledge and this ability to lead to Nangipedia Bach Khoa project, later becoming Wikipedia.
In the early 2000s, Wiki technology was admitted to the company as a collaborative software
It is often used to support traffic in the project, build intranet, and write documents, first for acquaintances to use computers
In December 2002, Socialtext starts a commercial open source wiki
The open source wiki software is widely available, downloaded and installed in these years
Today some companies use Wiki such as the only collaborative software and to replace the Intranet difficult to change
Wiki software can be used more in companies, behind the firewall, for public internet.

Wiki can also provide WYSIWYG editing capabilities for users, usually through a JavaScript control that translates the format instructions imported by graphics into corresponding HTML or Wikitex tags
In these deployments, the mark of a newly edited version of the page is created and sent to the server transparently, protecting users from this technical part.
An example of this is Visualeditor on Wikipedia
However, Wysiwyg controls do not always provide all the features available in the wiki and some users do not want to use the WysiwyG editor.
Therefore, many of these pages offer a number of vehicles to directly edit the Wiki text.
Some wiki storage of changes are made for conventional wiki pages, all versions of the page are stored.
This means that the authors can reconcile the older version of the page if necessary due to the mistake, such as the content that accidentally deleted or the site has been destroyed to include the text causing discomfort.Or toxic or other unsuitable content.
In the text of most pages, there are usually many super -text links to other pages in the wiki
This non -linear navigation form is more rooted for Wiki than the navigation diagrams of the structure
Users can also create any number of index pages or indexes, with class classification or any form of organization they want.
This may be a challenge to maintain by hand, because many authors and users can create and delete pages in a special way, without organization.
Wiki can provide one or more ways to classify or tag pages to support the maintenance of those index pages
Some wiki, including the original, have a backward link, display all pages linking to a certain page
Normally, Wiki can also create links to unprecedented pages, as a way to invite others to share what they know about a new topic for Wiki
Wiki users can often tag pages with a category or keyword to help other users find the article easier
For example, a user creates a new article about cycling in cold weather that can tag this page under the categories of travel, winter sports and cycling
This will help other users find the article easier.
A website similar to Wikipedia can be created by open source mediawiki
Open source code Mediawiki is written in PHP programming language and is commonly used by websites written in the form of wiki such as Wikimedia websites, Wiki Wiki Website Wikitravel, Wikiz Wikiz website ...
To use MediaWiki, you can access the MediaWiki website, then download and install it according to the appropriate language version
The installation steps are very simple and intuitive.

Kennedy Planet HMS Ark Royal
Geosynchronous orbit synchronous orbit, abbreviated as GSO is the orbit of the Earth as the mind with the trajectory cycle that matches the Earth's self -rotation phenomenon around the axis for 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds a astronomical day
Thus, for an observer on the Earth's surface, the synchronization of rotation and orbit cycle means that the object on the synchronous orbit will return to the same position in the sky after one after oneday
During that day, that object could stand still compared to the Earth's surface or outline an Analemma curve depending on the tilt and eccentricity of the trajectory.
The circular senior orbit will have a constant height of 35,786 km 22,236 mi and this is also a large axle for all other synchronous orbits
